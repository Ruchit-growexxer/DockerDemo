How to work with Project:

start.sh -> simply run ./start.sh to run the project

stop.sh -> If you want to stop all the running containres for this then run ./stop.sh

reset.sh -> it will reset all your data related to this project (Images,network,containers)

restart.sh -> It will stop the containers and start again.
